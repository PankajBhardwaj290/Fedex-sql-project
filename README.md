# FedEx Logistics Optimization – SQL Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

#This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing FedEx logistics operations using SQL-based data analysis. The objective is to identify delivery delays, warehouse inefficiencies, route bottlenecks, and agent performance issues, and to provide data-driven business recommendations for improving overall operational efficiency and service-level performance.

🎯 Key Objectives

Clean and prepare logistics datasets for analysis

Measure delivery delays, on-time delivery performance, and SLA compliance

Evaluate warehouse utilization and capacity efficiency

Analyze route efficiency and delay patterns

Assess delivery agent performance using ranking and percentage metrics

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server compatible queries)

Relational databases (Orders, Shipments, Routes, Warehouses, Delivery Agents)

Window Functions, CTEs, Subqueries, Conditional Aggregation

GitHub for version control and documentation
